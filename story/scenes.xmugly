   (( n: I was just about to tell Anna the horrible implications for saying something like that, when the Universe did it for me.. ))

   (( n: As if on cue, the lights went out. ))

   (( m: Leave us alone! ))

   (( n: The ghost kept approaching us... Her floating "stride" didn't even break... ))

   (( m: STOP IT! ))

   (( n: I swung the Athame and cut the ghost straight throught the middle. ))

   (( n: The ghost of Clara torn in half like a cloud of smoke. ))

   (( n: She no longer appeared solid, like a person... ))

   (( n: Clara slowly faded into the mist... ))

   (( n: And just like that... She was gone for good. ))

   (( a: Matthew, you did it! ))

   (( n: Maybe I could find some answers here... ))

   (( n: !!! ))

   (( n: Uh-oh... ))

   (( n: I froze. Literally. The temperature in the room seemed to take a sudden drop. I could practically see my breath in little puffs of steam. ))

   (( n: Wait a minute... What am I doing?! ))

   (( n: I was standing in a room, on my own, in a mansion where I knew there was a ghost. ))

   (( n: I mean, it's a game. I know it's just a game. But what does that make me? ))

   (( n: Can I still die? Will I come back? Will it hurt? Will I remember dying? ))

   (( n: A thousand questions where in my mind. ))

   (( n: Then I turned to another thought. One that had occured to me ages ago, but had brushed it off because it couldn't bear thinking about it... ))

   (( n: What if I wasn't in a game? ))

   (( n: What was that thing called? "The Truman Show delusion"? When someone thinks they're the main character in a reality TV show? ))

   (( n: Was there a name for the video game equivalent of that? ))

   (( n: I started thinking... Was I a guy who'd realised he was in a game... ))

   (( n: Or was I a man who was going mad in a supernatural mansion? ))

   (( n: Or was I just mad? ))

   (( n: Could I really be going mad? ))

   (( n: ... ))

   (( n: I had been prolonging it enough with my thoughts... I had to face whatever it was behind me. ))

   (( n: Barrels filled with wine lined all over the room. ))

   (( n: At least, I think it was wine. But with how the rest of this mansion was designed, there were probably seven or eight barrels that probably opened up to a secret passage... ))

   (( n: I took another look around and noticed... something else. ))

   (( n: There was an old suit of armor on a wooden stand. ))
